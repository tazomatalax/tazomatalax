# 👋 Hi, I'm Tasman van der Woude  

🚀 Technologist at [Scion Research](https://www.scionresearch.com/), working on the intersection of **biotechnology, digital twins, and hardware systems**.  
I enjoy designing tools that bridge biology, engineering, and software — from **bioreactor control systems** to **IoT sensor networks** and **automation workflows**.  

---

## 🔬 What I'm Working On
- 🧪 **AI-assisted bioreactor control systems** for portable and scalable experimentation.  
- 🌱 **Bioeconomy innovation**: exploring new feedstocks (like dairy wastewater fats) for PHA and sustainable materials.  
- 💻 **Digital Twin platforms**: integrating sensors, SQL/Grafana data, and real-time analytics.  
- ⚡ **Side projects**:   
  - Home Assistant automations for smart family life (like chore tracking dashboards).
  - SaaS development
  - AI Tools
  - Homelab Engineering

---

## 🛠️ Tech & Tools
- **Languages:** Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Shell (zsh), a bit of C/C++ for microcontrollers.  
- **Platforms:** Raspberry Pi, ESP32, microcontrollers, containerized services.  
- **Software/Frameworks:** n8n, Grafana, Mycodo, Fabric, Jupyter, React.  
- **Other Interests:** Modbus/PLC integration, AI-assisted knowledge management, and low-cost sensor hardware.  

---

## 📈 Current Themes
- Making **scientific experimentation more portable, affordable, and transparent**.  
- Building **interfaces that make data useful in real-time**, not just after the fact.  
- Combining **biology + hardware + software** in creative ways.
